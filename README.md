Simple POS system build in PHP, jquery, database files = text

Normal use should work well. 
Development is 
- the agregation of al the tickets (revenues, reports etc)
- bluetooth connection to a sumup-system (or other systems)
- ....

Database are txt files
- ticket for a person
- file with the products
- revenues

What can the system do?
- load products
- make a ticket of an order
- pay directly or write it to a receipt per person
- alter a receipt

Get it working?
- download the zip-file
- store all files on a webserver
- it should work directly (otherwise contact me:)

  

Like it?
